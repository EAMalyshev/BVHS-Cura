# Downloading Cura
I use Cura to slice all the files for this printer and setting up the profiles and materials for this printer is very easy.

Lets start by identifying your type of Macbook. Go to the top left and click the Apple logo, then select "About This Mac"
<br><br>

<br><br>
If next to "Chip" it says Apple M1, we will download "MacOS-ARM64.dmg", if it says anything else like "Intel", we will download "MacOS-x64.dmg"

<br><br>
Download the latest version of <a href="https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/">Ultimaker Cura</a> to your computers desktop based on your macbook.

<br><br>
Double Click the .dmg file and agree to the Terms of Service.

<br><br>
This will open the following window.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Rather than dragging this into your applications folder, drag and drop this onto your desktop.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Cura will now stay on your desktop and you can access it anytime!
<br><br>
This step is important. RIGHT-CLICK the application, and press "Open", then press "Open" again. This will open Cura. You only have to do this once; this is because Apple doesnt "Approve" a lot of apps outside of the App Store, and as a result, some apps require you to manually confirm that this app is safe the first time you open it.

# Cura Setup
Welcome to Cura!
<br><br>
<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-06 at 11 15 34 AM" src="https://github.com/EAMalyshev/BVHS-Cura/assets/155656835/293182a3-c470-4ce1-b9cf-d03794aecb3c">
<br><br>
Lets start configuring everything. Press "Get Started", agree to the Terms of Service by pressing "Agree", skip the short info slide by pressing "Next", and skip making a Ultimaker account by pressing "Skip". This will bring you to the printer selection screen. Press "Non Ultimaker printer".
<br><br>
<img width="602" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-06 at 11 20 58 AM" src="https://github.com/EAMalyshev/BVHS-Cura/assets/155656835/bbf638be-cd29-403c-a197-62ee2d38a2d9">
<br><br>
On the following menu, press the dropdown menu labeled "Add a non-Networked printer".

<br><br>
Press "Next" (We did select a random printer, but we will delete this later. This is only temporary), then skip the info screen by pressing "Skip", then press "Finish".
<br><br><br><br>

# Configuration and Importing Profiles
Lets setup everything to easily slice and send files to the printer. This section can be a bit more difficult for some users to pay attention.
<br><br>
Lets start by installing the Moonraker plugin, which allows us to send files wirelessly. Press "MarketPlace" on the top right.

<br><br>
Then search for "moonraker" in the search bar. This will pull up the moonraker plugin. Press install, then close out the window.
