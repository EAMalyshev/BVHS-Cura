# Downloading Cura
I use Cura to slice all the files for this printer and setting up the profiles and materials for this printer is very easy.

Lets start by identifying your type of Macbook. Go to the top left and click the Apple logo, then select "About This Mac"

If next to "Chip" it says Apple M1, we will download "MacOS-ARM64.dmg", if it says anything else like "Intel", we will download "MacOS-x64.dmg"

Rather than dragging this into your applications folder, drag and drop this onto your desktop.

Cura will now stay on your desktop and you can access it anytime!
<br><br>
This step is important. RIGHT-CLICK the application, and press "Open", then press "Open" again. This will open Cura. You only have to do this once; this is because Apple doesnt "Approve" a lot of apps outside of the App Store, and as a result, some apps require you to manually confirm that this app is safe the first time you open it.
