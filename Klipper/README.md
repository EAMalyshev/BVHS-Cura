# Klipper tuning and RPI documentation
Im going to wait on this so I have time to think. Theres a lot of things to document and this isnt going to as extensive and user friendly as the Cura setup.
<br>
Most of the things there is to known can be read in the <a href="https://www.klipper3d.org/Overview.html">Klipper Documentation</a>. The only things I will cover in this document is setup of the raspberry pi, setup of the access point, setting up KIAUH, installing klipper, setting up connecting over UART and usb, my basic tuning on this printer, and the custom .def.json for this printer on Cura. This was a very large project for me, but I really enjoyed it and hope others can benifit or learn from it.
