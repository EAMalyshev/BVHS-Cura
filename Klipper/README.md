# Klipper Tuning and RPI Documentation!
Welcome to the documentation of the prtinters. This isnt going to as extensive and user friendly as the Cura setup.
<br>

# What Will be Covered?
Most of the things there is to known can be read in the <a href="https://www.klipper3d.org/Overview.html">Klipper Documentation</a>. The only things I will cover in this document is setup of the raspberry pi, setup of the access point, setting up KIAUH, installing klipper, setting up connecting over UART and usb, my basic tuning on this printer, and the custom .def.json for this printer on Cura. This was a very large project for me, but I really enjoyed it and hope others can benifit or learn from it.

# The Raspberry Pi
The entire klipper setup runs on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+. It has 1GBs of ram which is enough for 2 basic cartesian printers running at low speeds and possibly a webcam, which I didnt implement incase it violated privacy in some way.
