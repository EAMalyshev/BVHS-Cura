# Cura
Lets get this started!
<br>
<br>
PLEASE ASK A LIBRARIAN FOR PERMISSIONS BEFORE DOING THIS!!!
<br><br>
Setup for the first time is difficult for some and will take roughly 30 minutes (for me it took 5 minutes, but Ive done this many times). <br>
This guide may seem long, but it is just descriptive to help people who may not be as knowledgeable about this.
<br>
Once you are done, sending files to the printer takes less than 2 minutes
<br><br><br><br>

# Downloading Cura
3-5 minutes
<br>
I use Cura to slice all the files for this printer and setting up the profiles and materials for this printer is very easy.

<br>
Lets start by identifying your type of Macbook. Go to the top left and click the Apple logo, then select "About This Mac"
<br><br>

<br><br>
If next to "Chip" it says Apple M1, we will download "MacOS-ARM64.dmg", if it says anything else like "Intel", we will download "MacOS-x64.dmg"
<br><br>

<br><br>
Download the latest version of <a href="https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/">Ultimaker Cura</a> to your computers desktop based on your macbook.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Double Click the .dmg file and agree to the Terms of Service.
<br><br>
<img width="639" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-06 at 10 49 54 AM" src="https://github.com/EAMalyshev/BVHS-Cura/assets/155656835/0d98411f-e9f5-4b23-807b-d85ce1590443">
<br><br>
This will open the following window.
<br><br>
<img width="681" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-06 at 10 51 21 AM" src="https://github.com/EAMalyshev/BVHS-Cura/assets/155656835/1bbed668-4ef9-424e-8578-dd056b1f1333">
<br><br>
Rather than dragging this into your applications folder, drag and drop this onto your desktop.
<br><br>
<img width="953" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-06 at 10 53 22 AM" src="https://github.com/EAMalyshev/BVHS-Cura/assets/155656835/7cfb6f29-c0d0-4d6a-857f-a12764ece7f7">
<br><br>
Cura will now stay on your desktop and you can access it anytime!
<br><br>
This step is important. RIGHT-CLICK the application, and press "Open", then press "Open" again. This will open Cura. You only have to do this once; this is because Apple doesnt "Approve" a lot of apps outside of the App Store, and as a result, some apps require you to manually confirm that this app is safe the first time you open it.
<br><br><br><br>

# Cura Setup
3-5 minutes
<br>
Welcome to Cura!
<br><br>
<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-06 at 11 15 34 AM" src="https://github.com/EAMalyshev/BVHS-Cura/assets/155656835/293182a3-c470-4ce1-b9cf-d03794aecb3c">
<br><br>
Lets start configuring everything. Press "Get Started", agree to the Terms of Service by pressing "Agree", skip the short info slide by pressing "Next", and skip making a Ultimaker account by pressing "Skip". This will bring you to the printer selection screen. Press "Non Ultimaker printer".
<br><br>
<img width="602" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-06 at 11 20 58 AM" src="https://github.com/EAMalyshev/BVHS-Cura/assets/155656835/bbf638be-cd29-403c-a197-62ee2d38a2d9">
<br><br>
On the following menu, press the dropdown menu labeled "Add a non-Networked printer".
<br><br>
<img width="602" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-06 at 11 35 01 AM" src="https://github.com/EAMalyshev/BVHS-Cura/assets/155656835/56a47ae1-44e0-4bb7-84f8-c2c21426a3b6">
<br><br>
Press "Next" (We did select a random printer, but we will delete this later. This is only temporary), then skip the info screen by pressing "Skip", then press "Finish".
<br><br><br><br>

# Configuration and Importing Profiles
7-10 minutes
<br>
Lets start by installing the Moonraker plugin, which allows us to send files wirelessly. Press "MarketPlace" on the top right.
<br><br>
<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-06 at 11 43 23 AM" src="https://github.com/EAMalyshev/BVHS-Cura/assets/155656835/5f64d522-6d60-4437-b45a-74fce5a60350">
<br><br>
Then search for "moonraker" in the search bar. This will pull up the moonraker plugin. Press install, agree the plugin license by pressing "Accept", then close out the window.
<br><br>
<img width="779" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-06 at 11 49 40 AM" src="https://github.com/EAMalyshev/BVHS-Cura/assets/155656835/2e6b08f6-9c15-4d63-aeb0-5b2f16d6ae14">
<br><br>
This part is optional, but you can configure your preferences, theme, etc. by going to the "Preferenecs" button on the top left, then pressing "Configure Cura...".
<br><br>
<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-06 at 11 54 51 AM" src="https://github.com/EAMalyshev/BVHS-Cura/assets/155656835/b6373f50-c927-4a4c-9bee-be0742e703e7">
<br><br>
This will pull up the following menu. You dont have to touch any of them, but I personally choose to change Currency to "$", Theme to "Ultimaker Dark", Turn on "Slice automatically", Turn off "Scale extremely small models", and Turn off "Send (anonymous) print information". After you finish, close out the window.
<br><br>
<img width="781" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-06 at 11 59 41 AM" src="https://github.com/EAMalyshev/BVHS-Cura/assets/155656835/070b4667-9d8d-4466-b872-72d5e166746c">
<br><br>
Before we close out cura, lets open the configuration folder by pressing "Help", then "Show Configuration Folder". This will open a folder in your finder. We will access this later.
<br><br>
<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-06 at 12 10 35 PM" src="https://github.com/EAMalyshev/BVHS-Cura/assets/155656835/63b9ad63-d9d3-4fdb-9e8d-fed70864358c">
<br><br>
After installing the Moonraker plugin and changing your preferences, close out of Cura. This will apply all the changes youve made. Now we can pull up the folder we opened earlier.
<br><br>
<img width="916" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-06 at 12 13 07 PM" src="https://github.com/EAMalyshev/BVHS-Cura/assets/155656835/8a56c457-eb6f-4cbc-b3dd-2cff18125889">
<br><br>
This folder is used to manage everything in Cura. We are going to add in a definition for our BVHS printers.
<br><br>
Download the "<a href="https://github.com/EAMalyshev/BVHS-Cura/blob/main/Cura/creality_ender3pro.def.json">creality_ender3pro.def.json</a>" file from this github.
<br><br>

<br><br>
After you place the file in the definitions folder, you can close this folder out and once again load Cura (Sometimes you will need to quit cura again for it to finally show up)
<br><br>
<img width="505" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-06 at 12 50 07 PM" src="https://github.com/EAMalyshev/BVHS-Cura/assets/155656835/64470c1a-7bfb-4811-89d6-422df24cb9da">

<br><br><br><br>

# Slicing Your First File!
1-3 minutes
<br>
Phew, were done with the configuration. Now lets slice a file for the printer to use.
<br><br>
Download a 3D model from any site like <a href="https://www.printables.com/">Printables</a>, or <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a>. You should download a .stl, .obj, .3mf, or any other object mesh file. Drag and dop this file to Cura. You can slice a <a href="https://github.com/EAMalyshev/BVHS-Cura/blob/main/Cura/3DBenchy.stl">3D Benchy</a> if you dont know what to print :) 
<br><br>
<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-07 at 7 41 49 AM" src="https://github.com/EAMalyshev/BVHS-Cura/assets/155656835/ff0fa35b-d9e3-4a7a-bb5f-38396fefe2cf">
<br><br>
If you need supports for the model, go to the "Support" tab under the slicing settings and turn on "Generate Support". You can also choose between "Normal" supports which are like scaffolding, or "Tree" supports which are more organic and try to make it as easy as possible to remove supports but can take more material and take longer to print.
<br><br>
<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-07 at 7 48 54 AM" src="https://github.com/EAMalyshev/BVHS-Cura/assets/155656835/c7e4836a-0a4b-438e-bec6-6f8720b10ed3">
<br><br>
Now press "Slice" if you didnt select "Automatically Slice" under preferences. You can check how your print will look under the "Preview" tab.
<br><br>
<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-07 at 7 54 12 AM" src="https://github.com/EAMalyshev/BVHS-Cura/assets/155656835/ec070f2e-f32e-45e6-82e9-3dc48be0893f">
<br><br>
If everything seems right, Select the arrow next to "Save To Disk" and select "Upload to Ender 3 Pro".
<br><br>
<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-07 at 7 55 20 AM" src="https://github.com/EAMalyshev/BVHS-Cura/assets/155656835/45cbde01-26c5-44db-a090-efd604a924e9">

<br><br>
In the "Network Name:" section (also known as the SSID), enter "printer". For the "Password: ", enter "password". Then press "Join". This will connect you to the printers access point. You will have to connect to the Blue Valley network again to be able to access the internet.

<br><br>
You can now press "Upload to Ender 3 Pro", rename the file to your desired name if needed, and select "Start Print Job". If you want to access it via the web interface, read about this under the <a href="https://github.com/EAMalyshev/BVHS-Cura/tree/main/Klipper">Klipper Folder</a> but its not recommended and is more difficult.

<br><br>
Youre done!! Your print will now start.
